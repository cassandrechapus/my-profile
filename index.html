				<h1>My name is Cassandre Chapus</h1>
				<img src="Images/logo.jpeg" class="img-circle" width="100px" height="100px" alt="Cassandre">
					<p>
						 I was born on February 16, 2006, in Sète, France. I grew up in this beautiful southern region, surrounded by my older sister and younger brother. Passionate about science and mathematics, I completed my secondary education in Montpellier, specializing in mathematics and economic and social sciences. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration at ESSEC in Singapore.
						 <br>
						 My interest in the practical applications of mathematics in economics has steered me towards a career in international trade. Being multilingual, I am fluent in English and Spanish, I am learning Italian, and I understand Serbo-Croatian due to my heritage, which enriches my international perspective.

				<h2><strong>Baking!</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Baking has been a passion of mine since my childhood, passed down to me by my father who shared his love for it with me. Among all the recipes, tiramisu remains my favorite. It’s always a pleasure to prepare this dessert, blending flavors and ensuring the perfect texture.
						<br>
						I enjoy baking because it is a true source of relaxation. It’s an activity that allows me to clear my mind and focus on something creative and tangible.
						<br>
						I take every opportunity to bake cakes, especially for important celebrations like Christmas or birthdays. It’s my way of contributing to these special family moments, and I love seeing everyone happy to eat what I’ve prepared.

				<h2><strong>Travel!</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Travel is one of my main passions. In 2017, I had the incredible opportunity to travel across Southeast Asia for a month with my family. We visited Vietnam, Cambodia, Bali, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. This trip allowed me to discover beautiful landscapes and very different cultures, and it taught me to adapt and stay open to new situations.
						<br>
						In addition to Asia, I have also traveled to South Africa, and Mauritius, as well as to the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Each destination offered something unique, whether it was in terms of nature, history, or culture. I have also visited Lebanon and Jordan, where I was able to learn more about the ancient history and contemporary life of these regions.
					</p>

				<h2><strong>Formula 1!</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Formula 1 is another one of my great passions. Since I was a child, I’ve been immersed in this world, as my mother used to watch the races when I was young. It’s been three years now that I have been following it more seriously and in depth.
						<br>
						In November 2022, I had an incredible experience attending the last race of the year in Abu Dhabi, accompanied by my mother. It was fantastic to feel the adrenaline and excitement emanating from the crowd and to see the cars speeding around the track. More recently, in September 2023, I had the chance to attend the Singapore Grand Prix. Living in Singapore for my studies, I did not miss the opportunity to once again immerse myself in the electrifying atmosphere of Formula 1.
